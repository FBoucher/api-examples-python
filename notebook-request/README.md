# Reka Research with raw HTTP requests

This example demonstrates how to use Reka Research API with raw HTTP requests to find up-to-date IRS tax-compliance regulations and guidance. You'll learn how to make API calls using the `requests` library, parse the responses, and view the model's reasoning steps as it searches for current information.
